The last day of the Open. I arrived at Sadler Center with a large
coffee in hand and checked the pairings. Rematch, Tevis Tsai!  I'm
sure he hoped to exact a friendly revenge for his loss yesterday.
Again, Tevis had black, and, again, he took star points. Same as 
yesterday, I took star points and he approached. I protected the
corner and then approached his lone upper left stone.

Tevis then made a tight pincer, which I felt wasn't working so well
with the lower half of the board. I happily took the corner. He then
protected the lower right corner, and I used a standard invasion, though
I'm not clear about its effectiveness with black K4 on the board.

I played lightly, and I attached on top of K4 willing to give up the
two white stones on the left. We got into an early struggle but I was
able to make at least one eye and move out. Black 43 seemed risky to
me given the condition of the black stones in lower right. I spent a
lot of time looking for a way to kill, unsuccessfully, but I at least
got outside strength as compensation and I decided to invest in
that with a center move at white 62.

Black invaded which seemed logical, and I played a shoulder hit to
emphasize the center-facing influence I had built. White needed to
make a base so I got the upper right area very naturally. At black 77,
Tevis switched strategies and returned to building his
framework. Black 79 closed the last invasion point but I was convinced
white had a better position and turned at move 80. After increasing
white's influence, I returned to attack the right black group with
white 100. While I wasn't sure of a win, I was starting to feel good
about this game. Black struggled and couldn't find a way to make life.

When Black resigned, I still had almost 20 minutes on my
clock. Finally, I played game where I had spent time on parts of the
game that deserved it.

6-2! I was happy with this result and decided to take the remainder
of the day off from playing rated games.

I went downstairs and joined up with the Shawn Moore and David Rolsky
and we went to a nice spot down the street from Greenleaf. Shawn
Ligocki and Becci Torrey made an appearance later, but David and I
split off to catch the Mingjiu Jiang 7P lecture on sabaki in the early
fuseki. 

The lecture was meant for players 5 kyu or stronger, but I
found that the content was not beyond me. It helped that I had studied
the Chinese Opening a bit in AYD. It's my standard opening, and I used
it in many games at Congress. Mingjiu did a a great job explaining the
meaning behind the standard moves and the variations.

After the lecture, I headed back to get my Open game reviewed. Atsushi
Katsura 5P was giving kyu level reviews in the Game Room starting at
3:00 PM. I arrived a bit late so there was already a pretty long line
of folks in front of me. Satoru Inoue 1D was translating. I had
learned of Satoru through
[Ben Hong's fantastic blog](http://bengozen.com). He did a great job,
and I hoped I would be able to get a review in. Unfortunately, the
reviews went a bit long, but as usual I found that watching the other
reviews was incredibly informative. Atsushi Katsura's comments and
insights were applicable beyond specific games.

Afterwards, I joined up with the Boston AYDers and headed to a nice
sandwhich shop. During the lunch conversation,
[Osaka Go Camp](http://osakago.byethost22.com/camp.html?i=1) came up
which both Becci Torrey and Shawn Ligocki had attended. A 3-week
affair led by Meada Ryo, it sounded like an amazing way to immerse
yourself into Go in Japan. In-seong also does Go camps, but they are
briefer events in Europe. Still, a 3-day camp in the United States
would be pretty amazing and the Boston AYDers had mentioned it
to In-seong, and he said he would consider it. Fingers crossed.

Back at the Sadler center, I relaxed and observed some games. The Pair
Go Tournament would be starting at 7:00 PM, and I thought I might
watch it a bit. Dan Schmidt 4K wanted to play a casual no-komi game,
and I obliged. We both played some questionable moves, but Dan was
leading territorially.  However, towards the end of the middle game
Dan overplayed, and I was able to swing a twenty point gain and
finished with a 7 point lead. It was a lot of fun, and probably a good
reminder to be a bit more patient in the beginning and avoid
complications.

It was my last evening, so I grabbed Nate Eagle for some drinks at
Greenleaf. We ended up talking late into the night about Go, life, and
pretty much everything else. Nate was doing an incredible job
co-running Congress this year with Diego, and they deserve praise for
their efforts and attention to detail. It was getting late, and while
US Go Congress 2018 was at an end for myself, Nate still had two more
days to oversee. With misty eyes we hugged, and I headed back to my
hotel.
