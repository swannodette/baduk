title:  "4 Kyu AYD"

I haven't posted since US Go Congress 2018, but not because I've
stopped playing. Life has simply gotten busy, and I've relaxed my Go
studies to free up more time for my other interests. I think
it's been for the best and probably helped my Go advance consistently, if
not quickly. 

These days I don't have much of a study regimen - I do tsumego only
when I really feel like it, and I hardly read my theory books anymore.
Instead I've been watching In-seong's Highlights videos, and I've found
these 20 minute distillations to be an efficient way to pick up new
ideas as well as reinforce good habits.

I'm still taking too long in the opening stage, but I'm able to
make it to move 100 before hitting byo-yomi. I'm holding my own
against AGA 3 and 4 kyus, and tonight I finally broke 4 kyu under
In-seong's rating system. It's taken me 2 and a half years to advance two
stones in AYD, and honestly I'm perfectly ok with that. If I
can continue to average around a stone a year I'll be happy.
