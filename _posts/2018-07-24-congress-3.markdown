This day started off much like the last. A styrofoam bowl of Cheerios
plus banana and weak coffee before the short walk to the Sadler
Center. My over all record so far was 1-1, so it was not at all clear
how the rest of my games would go.

Again I sat down at my assigned table with a cup of coffee,
awaited my opponent, and admired the wooden ceiling. While getting to
Williamsburg was a bit of trouble, it was hard to complain about the
tournament room. My opponent arrived and this time it was Justine, a 6 kyu
from the West Coast. It was still a few minutes before 9:00 AM so we
chatted a bit about Go. This was not only her first Go Congress, but
her first tournament ever. She played at a fairly active club back at home and
she was not the only player in attendance. Like myself, she had come
late to the tournament, so this was actually her first proper day. I
explained the clocks a bit and the rules around passing stones at the
end of the game.

This game was relatively straightforward after some light early
complications. Due to a few slow plays I was able to get a comfortable
territorial lead and she didn't try anything more aggressive to take
back control of the game. As this was Justine's first tournament game,
I suspect a few of the more cautious moves can be attributed to
that. She pincered at move 10 and then probably blocked on the wrong
side after I jumped in. The knight's move at 16 was bit strange since
J3 was oddly placed and white did not have a stone on or around C10.

At move 20 I decided to attach, though I wondered if that was too
early. We both handled it a bit clumsily as was clear by the
result. After black 49, I thought I was closing in on a clear
territorial lead. At move 53 I could no longer resist the urge to
exploit the weakness at H4. After black 95 I thought I had the win and
the endgame proceeded pretty simply after that. Since there was a lack
of complications, I managed my time a bit better than yesterday, though I
still ended up in byo-yomi.

When we counted I had a solid lead. We thanked each other for the game
and I decided to grab lunch. Ien was playing a rated self pair game
against another AYDer so I went on a short walk to Aromas Cafe. This
took me through the pleasant William & Mary campus and I had a relaxed
lunch on my own before heading back for a review with Yilun Yang at
3:00 PM.

I got back a bit early and spotted Justine and I invited her to the
review but she was headed off. So I headed downstaire to the Game Room
where the review was taking place.

Yilun Yang 7P is one of my favorite authors and lectures on Go. I
continue to return to his slim distilled books of wisdom time and time
again. I also really loved his reviews in 2016. He has adds an element
of humor to his reviews which brings much needed lightness to a win or
loss. He pointed out a good number of my bad moves and my misreads. At
the end of the review he looked at my badge and said he thought I was
stronger than 6 kyu and hoped that I would be a dan one day. That felt
pretty good.

<p style="font-size: 12px; margin: 1em 0;">Reviewing with In-seong</p>
</div>

Back upstairs I found Ien and several AYDers from the Boston Go scene
including Shawn Moore 6K, Dan Schmidt 4K, Shawn Ligocki 1K, and Becci
Torrey 2D. We took the short walk to Greenleaf, a bar with decent
fare. We had a long relaxed lunch where we discussed our backgrounds
and our love of Go. One of the interesting tidbits that arose
was that Dan Schmidt worked on Guitar Hero and Rockband as a software
developer.

After dinner we returned and relaxed. In-seong did his evening review
and the AYD crew started to steadily grow around In-seong. I talked
briefly with fellow student and opponent Yoko Ohashi 6 kyu. She
learned Go when she was 50 and has been attending US Go congress for
years! Then while standing around, Lee Ann Bowie the president of the
Seattle Go Center introduced herself since I had misunderstood how to
use my lanyard, which she clarified, and we had a long chat about
Seattle and Go. She also had encountered Go decades ago. As
articulated by others, I agreed that one of the things that make Go
Congress so special - that over the board people separated by many
years can speak as peers. There was in fact a tournament in which
players must be separated by at least 40 years!

After the review In-seong wanted to head to the pub for a big hangout
with AYDers, the Korean pros, and other folks from the Congress. We
picked Greenleaf since they had decent snacks and cheap pitchers. We
stayed late into the night. Myself and others got to have a nice long
chat with In-seong about his Go background and his life in Europe.
As the conversation carried on and the spirits brightened, it felt
more like family than an unlikely meeting of people known to each
other only by their truncated KGS handles.

The following day was the off day, so most folks planning on taking it
easy since they still had three more Open games to look forward
to. For myself, I was already registered for the 4 round Diehard
tournament starting at 9 AM the following morning. These games were
only 30 minutes main time with 5 periods of 30 second byo-yomi.  While
2-1 was headed in the right direction I wasn't sure what tomorrow
would bring.
