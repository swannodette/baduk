title:  "US Go Congress 2018 Day 2"
date:   2018-07-22

Due to other obligations, I couldn't make it for the actual first day
of the [US Go Congress](http://gocongress.org/2018). I landed in Richmond,
Virginia on the second day around 11:00 AM and discovered the next
train wasn't departing for Williamsburg until 7:53 PM. That was a bit
of a downer, but I took a deep breath and grabbed some lunch and found
a nice cafe to kill some time.

While consuming a cold brew, I double checked our accommodations for
the tournament and I discovered the Airbnb that Ien Cheng and I booked
was a total scam and was located *4 miles* away from the William &
Mary campus. Ien was already en route from New York via Amtrak when I
notified him of the situation. He managed to quickly get a refund and
then booked the Governor's Inn which was a short five minute walk from
the train station and about a convenient fifteen minute walk to the
campus. Whew.

I finally boarded the same train Ien was on and I quickly spotted
him. We caught up on the hour long ride to Williamsburg. We were both
excited to return to US Go Congress after taking the previous year
off. The 2016 Congress in Boston was particularly memorable not
only as our first, but also as the first Congress after the immortal
showdown between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol. Sadly, this year neither of us
could manage to stay for the whole week. Instead, we both planned to
depart on Friday. However, at the last minute Ien had to shorten his
stay till Wednesday. Given the short window we both decided we had to
make the best of it.  While the Open tournament consists of only six
rounds, the Congress offers an abundant opportunities to play
rated games. Ien planned to leverage the popular Evening League
Tournament, and I decided I was going to play in the Diehard
Tournament, a four round affair on the Congress off-day.

We arrived at the Williamsburg station around 9:00 PM. Even though I
was a bit exhausted after being in transit for more than fifteen
hours, I wasn't about to go to sleep without checking into the
Congress and playing a quick game. We quickly dropped off our stuff
and headed out into the humid Virginian night.  Sunlight was fading
from the sky and the tall trees were alive with the summer sound of
nocturnal insects. On the way we noted a couple of interesting pubs
and restaurants and soon found ourselves walking past the college
stadium and then up the stairs of the Sadler Center. We spotted a few
people in the dim light wearing badges as we passed through the
sliding doors. Approaching the lobby, it became quite clear we had
found the place.

My friend [Nate Eagle](https://twitter.com/neagle) was seated in front
of a laptop carrying on the mysterious duties appropriate to a
co-director of the Congress. After some warm greetings, he registered
us and handed us our badges and a bag of the most amazing Congress
schwag. Nate had designed everything himself - the t-shirts, the
stickers, the buttons, and the coffee mugs. All of the items were
wonderful to behold and I'll definitely be cherishing them.

After catching up with Nate we spotted
[In-seong Hwang](https://senseis.xmp.net/?HwangInSeong) our
[American Yunguseng Dojang](http://ayd.yunguseng.com) teacher going
over a game in the lobby.  Neither Ien nor I had met him
in person. We walked over to say hello. He handed us a cool
AYD fan and we left them in peace to continue the review. There would
be plenty of time over the next couple of days to talk him and the
other students (30 in attendance!).

Ien and I headed up the spiral staircase in the lobby to the 3rd floor
to checkout Evening League. We checked in and I paired with a 5
kyu. He was from the Philadelphia area and had been involved in the
Philadelphia Open which, sadly, I had missed. The game was going
in my favor, but a last minute blunder ruined it and I ran
out of time. I could have taken it as a bad omen but I brushed it
off. I hadn't played in a couple of weeks and the loss only
fueled my eagerness to fill the following days with games.

It was getting late and I was starving, so we headed out. We stopped
in one of the college pubs and ordered some sandwiches. We didn't tarry
and we headed back to the hotel to catch some much needed sleep.

[I was rated as 6.6 kyu](http://agagd.usgo.org/player/22311/) and I
was confident my experience in AYD as well as my own study and play
regimen had given me the tools to prove that I had gained a
stone. Tomorrow and the following days would tell.
